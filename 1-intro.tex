\section{Introduction}

The widespread use of small, interconnected devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT) has generated a number of new possibilities in smart office environments in recent years. From temperature monitoring to motion tracking to the lights in the room, these IoT devices are becoming more prevalent in everyday situations. One of the core issues facing these devices, however, is the ability to securely integrate new devices into a pre-established network. This poster explores the different techniques for securely bootstrapping trust into devices and networks.
