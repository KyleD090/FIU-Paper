\section{Conclusion}

The aim of this poster was to explore the spectrum of out of band bootstrapping methods and what key characteristics they presented.
Each methodâ€™s security properties were surveyed, along with what sensors they would work best with.
By exploring these bootstrapping methods we have found many options that would work to ensure the security of IoT devices in a smart office environment.
